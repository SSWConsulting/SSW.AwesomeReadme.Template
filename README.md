#SSW Awesome Readme Template

![minions holding readme](banner.png)

## 💼 About the Project

A README can often be a potential contributor's first impression of your project. It communicates:

- How to contribute
- Where to donate
- Installation instructions

## 👁️ The Project's vision

Having a README template ensures that contributors have an easy time getting your project up and running, while also setting a high standard for organizational projects. We want to create a README template that developers can use to bootstrap their projects by making sure they have all of the relevant information filled out from the get-go.

## 🔭 Project Scope

This project aims to help developers create better README files by providing structured templates that cater to different project needs.

## ⛏️ Using the Template

- Copy the contents of the `readme-template.md` file into your project's README.md file.
- Fill out all of the fields (Replace the `{{ }}` placeholders with your project's information)
- Remove any sections that are not relevant to your project
